# Hello World REST API in PHP

This is a basic project that demonstrates how to build a REST API using PHP. The project consists of two main files:

1. `api.php` - A PHP file that responds to `GET` requests with a JSON message.
2. `index.php` - An HTML file that displays a "Hello World" message on a web page.
